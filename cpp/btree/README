This is another school project which provides a templated implementation
of a btree and btree iterator (capable of doing and in-order traverse of
the btree). There are const and non-const versions of the iterator. This
project demonstrates the use of developing templated classes, implementing
iterators for custom data structures, operator overloading, const-correctness,
iterator adaptors, and storing and finding data in a custom tree structure.
