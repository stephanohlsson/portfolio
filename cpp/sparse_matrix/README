This is a school project that I completed, which involved the 
implementation of a sparse matrix (only stores non-zero values).
This project demonstrates the use of constructors, copy control, 
destructors, static memebers, overloaded operators, friends, 
exception handling, dynamic memory management, pointers,
const-correctness, and seperation of implementation and 
interface. Although the implemenation is lengthy, I belive 
that the interface is clean and the internal concepts straightforward.
