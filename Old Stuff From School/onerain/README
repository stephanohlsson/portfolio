This is one of the projects that I completed for OneRain, Inc. It's
dubbed the 'data-agent' project. In short, it's a collection of 
scripts which scrape weather data from various sources and post them
into our database.

There are two abstract classes found in phplib - agentWrapper and 
agentGetter. The wrapper is the main script that is called from the
cron. It calls the generateSystemSource.py script, which generates
a file containing essentially sensor identifiers and timezone off-
sets. The wrapper then calls the getter script with the source file
generated from the .py script. The getter script queries the respective
web API and parses (via regular expressions) the data. It writes out a 
standardized file. The wrapper then takes this file and passes it to 
loadData, which converts all times to UTC, marks up the data in XML, 
and then posts it to the data-exchange servlet for entry into the 
database. loadData keeps track of last post times by writing the 
.times file. This ensures that only new data is posted to the exchange.

I've only included two of the actual getters, GetUSGS and GetMETAR. 
In reality, there are more like 10 or so (with more planned), so 
that's why we wanted to design a modular system. 

This code currently running in production.
