Welcome to my sample code portfolio! In /c, you will find a very simple
HTTP server, demonstrating some network programming abilities. In /cpp,
you will find two school projects demonstrating in-depth knowledge of C++. 
In /onerain, you will find code that I produced for my internship with 
OneRain, Inc, mostly PHP and python scripts. More in-depth information
can be found in the READMEs of each respective project.
